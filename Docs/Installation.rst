**Technical information**

QuickNII consists of two co-located executable components implemented in
two programming languages for historical reasons. The GUI component is
implemented in MXML+ActionScript (runs on Adobe Integrated Runtime,
which is bundled as "captive runtime", requiring no installation). A
slicer service running in the background is implemented in Java (and has
a bundled JRE requiring no installation). The two components communicate
via standard output and local TCP connections (using the loopback
interface).
